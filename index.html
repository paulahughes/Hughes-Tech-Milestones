    <h2> 1975-1977 </h2>
        <p><b>1975: </b>The January issue of Popular Electronics magazine features the Altair 8080, described as the "world's first minicomputer kit to rival commercial models." Two "computer geeks," Paul Allen and Bill Gates, offer to write software for the Altair, using the new BASIC language. On April 4, after the success of this first endeavor, the two childhood friends form their own software company, Microsoft. 
            <br> 
            <b>1976: </b>Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak start Apple Computers on April Fool's Day and roll out the Apple I, the first computer with a single-circuit board, according to Stanford University.  
            <br> 
            <b>1977: </b>Radio Shack's initial production run of the TRS-80 was just 3,000. It sold like crazy. For the first time, non-geeks could write programs and make a computer do what they wished. </p>

    <h2>1981 </h2>
        <p>The first IBM personal computer, code-named "Acorn," is introduced. It uses Microsoft's MS-DOS operating system. It has an Intel chip, two floppy disks and an optional color monitor. Sears & Roebuck and Computerland sell the machines, marking the first time a computer is available through outside distributors. It also popularizes the term PC.</p>

    <h2>1990 </h2>
        <p>By October of 1990, Tim had written the three fundamental technologies that remain the foundation of today’s web (and which you may have seen appear on parts of your web browser):

            <br> HTML: HyperText Markup Language. The markup (formatting) language for the web.
            <br> URI: Uniform Resource Identifier. A kind of “address” that is unique and used to identify to each resource on the web. It is also commonly called a URL.
            <br> HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Allows for the retrieval of linked resources from across the web.
            Tim also wrote the first web page editor/browser (“WorldWideWeb.app”) and the first web server (“httpd“). <br> By the end of 1990, the first web page was served on the open internet, and in 1991, people outside of CERN were invited to join this new web community.
            As the web began to grow, Tim realised that its true potential would only be unleashed if anyone, anywhere could use it without paying a fee or having to ask for permission. <br> Tim Berners-Lee, a researcher at CERN, the high-energy physics laboratory in Geneva, develops HyperText Markup Language (HTML), giving rise to the World Wide Web.</p>

     <h2>2001 </h2>
        <p>Apple unveils the Mac OS X operating system, which provides protected memory architecture and pre-emptive multi-tasking, among other benefits. Not to be outdone, Microsoft rolls out Windows XP, which has a significantly redesigned GUI.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>2009/2010 </h2> 
        <p><b>2009: </b> Microsoft launches Windows 7, which offers the ability to pin applications to the taskbar and advances in touch and handwriting recognition, among other features.
        <br>
        <b>2010:</b>Apple unveils the iPad, changing the way consumers view media and jumpstarting the dormant tablet computer segment.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>2016/2017</h2>
    <p><b>2016:</b> The first reprogrammable quantum computer was created. "Until now, there hasn't been any quantum-computing platform that had the capability to program new algorithms into their system. They're usually each tailored to attack a particular algorithm," said study lead author Shantanu Debnath, a quantum physicist and optical engineer at the University of Maryland, College Park.
    <br>
    <b>2017:</b>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is developing a new "Molecular Informatics" program that uses molecules as computers. "Chemistry offers a rich set of properties that we may be able to harness for rapid, scalable information storage and processing," Anne Fischer, program manager in DARPA's Defense Sciences Office, said in a statement. "Millions of molecules exist, and each molecule has a unique three-dimensional atomic structure as well as variables such as shape, size, or even color. This richness provides a vast design space for exploring novel and multi-value ways to encode and process data beyond the 0s and 1s of current logic-based, digital architectures. </p>
